Global Report Card Data retrieved 2021-08-01 from http://globalreportcard.org/docs/Global-Report-Card-Data-11.14.12.xlsx

From the file:
* These data are generated by linearly extrapolating between two years of test scores.
* These data are generated using 2007 state performance data applied to either 2008 or 2009 national and international testing data.
* State data is from 2004, 2005, and 2007. The 2006 state scores are simply the average between 2005 and 2007 state performance.
* The national data is from NAEP. The included years are 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009. We similarly substitute the two year average for missing years.
* The international data are from PISA. The years included are 2003, 2006, and 2009.
